UoB 2019-2020 DST Assessment 4

This project uses Sokoto Coventry Fingerprint Dataset (SOCOFing), https://www.kaggle.com/ruizgara/socofing 
This project is a brief look into Deep Learning CNNs for image recognition and classification.

The code for importing the labels for the fingers from the data can be found below :
